                    Chole Bhature, also known as Chana Bhatura, is a famous Punjabi dish enjoyed across India. Chickpeas are cooked in a handmade sauce with classic spices like cumin, coriander seeds, turmeric powder and chilli powder for only 10 minutes. For extra taste, onions, garlic and ginger are used. Smashing some chickpeas results in a lovely, thick consistency that's ideal for scooping up with bhatura (fluffy fried leavened bread). The hot and spicy chole/chickpeas stew pairs well with the crunchy puffed bhatura. Chole Bhature is a popular Indian vegetarian dish that is eaten for breakfast, lunch and dinner, and is occasionally served with lassi.
